<h2>Hardware Project: We had to choose a part of a computer such as the cpu, gpu, ram, motherboard or the operating system (Mac, Windows) and then make a poster about it.</h2>

<h2>Dream Computer: We had to choose the type of person that we would build the computer for and we had to find parts that would be in the computer, we had to say what operating system we would have in the computer, we had to say what software that we would put on the computer, we had to say what internet service that we would need and we had to say what products or software we would need to maintain the computer</h2>

<h2>CMU Creative Tasks: For each of the 2 units in CMU we had to make a creative task using the elements that we learned during the unit.</h2>
